Description
===========
FSViewer is a NeXT FileViewer lookalike for Window Maker. Viewing is
currently supported via browser mode and list mode. It has been written
in C using the WINGs library.  

Features
========
Browser and list modes, DND and file operations. All other features need
to be implemented.


Requirements
============
o Window Maker v0.60.0 If you use an older version of Window Maker
  FSViewer is broken :(
o libProplist. If you have installed Window Maker, you should have it.
o GCC.
0 Version >= 0.2.3b requires WindowMaker >= 0.70.0 but no libProplist


Platforms
=========
Version 0.1.1 compiled on Redhat 5.2 on Intel and Amiga (RH 5.1), SuSE
(unknown version) and Slackware 3.6
Version 0.2.1 compiled on Redhat 5.2 for Intel and Amiga (RH 5.1).
Version 0.2.3b compiled on SuSE 6.4/7.3, Mandrake 8.1 for Intel (with
WindowMaker 0.80.0)
  

Installation
============
gunzip and untar FSViewer.app-x.y.z.tar.gz
[prompt]$> tar zxvf FSViewer.app-x.y.z.tar.gz 
or
[prompt]$> gunzip FSViewer.app-x.y.z.tar.gz
[prompt]$> tar -xvf FSViewer.app-x.y.z.tar
or
[prompt]$> bunzip2 FSViewer.app-x.y.z.bz2
[prompt]$> tar -xvf FSViewer.app-x.y.z.tar
then
[prompt]$> cd FSViewer.app-x.y.z
[prompt]$> ./configure
[prompt]$> make
if the make goes ok su to root and
[prompt]$> make install
or 
[prompt]$> make install-strip
return to normal user mode.

The FSViewer binary (FSViewer) is now in /usr/local/GNUstep/Apps/FSViewer.app


Now copy icons.tar.gz into the install directory, the default is 
/usr/local/GNUstep/Apps/FSViewer.app and

[prompt]$> tar zxvf icons.tar.gz 
or
[prompt]$> gunzip icons.tar.gz
[prompt]$> tar -xvf icons.tar

Remark: Separate installation of icons is not necessary in
versions >= 0.2.3d, because they have been integrated into the standard
distribution.

If you want to access icons already installed and you want to use the short 
naming scheme i.e. no path or extension, the ICONDIR defaults file entry needs
to be set and the files need to have their own directories. So for xpms the
structure is /a/path/specified/in/ICONDIR/xpm and similarly for tiffs
/a/path/specified/in/ICONDIR/tiff. 


If you are using LinuxPPC/R4 you will need to use the --with-extralibs option
e.g.

./configure --with-extralibs="-lXt -lICE -lSM"

Slackware may require something like this:

./configure --with-extralibs="-lwraster -lgif"

(Could someone confirm that the above examples work?)

For those running on 8bits displays e.g. the Amiga, there is a compile
option --enable-clk when set to no (--enable-clk=no) will disable the
time stamp in the attributes inspector.

If you can't su to root, then use --prefix=/a/dir/you/can/write/to in the 
args to ./configure. For example:

[prompt]$> ./configure --prefix=/home/users/clernong/local
[prompt]$> make
[prompt]$> make install
or 
[prompt]$> make install-strip

The FSViewer binary (FSViewer) is now in 
/home/users/clernong/local/GNUstep/Apps/FSViewer.app

If this is a first time install, just run the app from the prompt. A defaults
file will be automatically created.

If this is an UPGRADE (from FSViewer < 0.2.0), backup your FSViewer defaults file in ~/GNUstep/Defaults and from the compilation directory cd into defs and run chdef. This is required to update the defaults file. Then go and run the app.


Documentation
=============
Documentation is included in the archive (english and french).
Once everything has been installed, start FSViewer.
You should be able to traverse the directory tree. The interface is split in 
to 3 sections. The shelf is an area to place frequently accessed directories 
or files. The pathview section depicts the current selected path and the 
browser columns lists the directory contents of the current selected path. 
Icons/Actions/Events can be set in the Inspector Panel.


TODO
====
There are many things to do. The following is a condensed version of the TODO
list from my scratch pad.

o Revert in the Inspector Panel (partially supported).
o Recycler Support.
o Implement a locate/find dialog. Done but it needs to be customisable.
o Improve the feel of the app.
o Add a panel to allow for 'quick' registering of apps.
o Change cursor during busy periods.
o Add in support for file completion for navigating the columns.
o Provide an interface to PGP to allow for file encryption via FSViewer.
o Implement other viewing modes.
o Implement a full preferences dialog.
