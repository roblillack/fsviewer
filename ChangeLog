	  it defaults to the file_plain xpm.

	  directories first or all jumbled up!
	o Modified the backing pixmap for the shelf and the scrollview.
	  A 64x64 pixmap is combined with the original pixmap. This allows
	  buttons to be used as the widget holder for the icons in the
	  scrollview.
	o The browser (kinda) mimics the NeXT movements i.e. it only scrolls
	  the browser if a file/folder is selected that is outside the current
	  columns.

	  related stuff.

	  Meta+key_press depending on keyboard setup.

	  plug a memory leak.

	  text is to wide for the button.

	  the moment, this will change in the next rev.
	o Now pass executable name to WMInitialiseApplication instead of full
	  pathname.
	o chdef now includes update for ROOT icon entry.
	o Changed chdef to actually insert the umount command into the 
	  defaults file, instead of just creating it. 
	o Added check for -lkvm for FreeBSD.
	o Added #include <fcntl.h> in FSUtils.h for FreeBSD.
	o Modified the regexp.h to just include string.h.
	o Removed all "extern char *strchr();" from regexp.c
	o Added "WMSynchronizeUserDefaults" to InitFilesDB so that the app does
	  not need to be restarted on the first run. I really need to read the
	  sources more clearly!
	o Exes now don't need an entry in the defaults file. If you can 
	  execute them, they will be executed!
	o Fixed bug in FSUtils where hostname is overwritten with disk size 
	  when Info panel is opened.
	o Added option to configure script to allow extra libs, that are not
	  looked for, be added.
	o Definitely removed all "extern char*" from reg*.c :)

	  the total and change some logic.

	o Implemented Revert in attributes inspector.

	  attribsInspector.c, used to seg fault if either group or user
	  was unknown.
	o Disabled hiding of app via 'h' key, leaving it up to Window Maker 
	  and changed the quit key from 'q' to '^q' to prevent accidents :).
	o Added in a "Console" menu option under the "Tools" menu. It launches
	  an xterm at the current directory.
	o The window and miniwindow icon titles are set with the current 
	  selection.

	  of unknown files to be viewed.
