# FSViewer.app

## What is this?

FSViewer is a NeXT FileViewer lookalike for Window Maker. Viewing is currently
supported via browser mode and list mode. It has been written in C using the
WINGs library.

The tool was originally written by George Clernon (1998-99) and later maintained
by Guido Scholz (2002-07).

This version is based on a Source Code repository I created in 2006 to keep
track of some fixes I added to the codebase over the years:

- Adapt window bottom to more closely resemble NeXt FileViewer
- Add support for showing available space on filesystem
- Switch build system to cmake
- Fix recurring crashes
- Fix main window not showing title bar
- Fix building on 64 bit systems
- Fix building on FreeBSD
- Fix building on OpenBSD
